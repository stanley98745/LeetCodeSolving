## Description
```
We are given a list nums of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.
Consider each adjacent pair of elements [a, b] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]] (with i >= 0).  
For each such pair, there are a elements with value b in the decompressed list.
Return the decompressed list.
```


## How to?

1. This lists is composed of freq and val, such as [freq1, val1, freq2, val2, ...].
   And it should be return by list.
   
2. Use "zip" for finding the frequency of the value.


## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def decompressRLElist(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        counts = []
        
        for freq, val in zip(nums[::2], nums[1::2]):
            counts += freq * [val]
        return counts
```
