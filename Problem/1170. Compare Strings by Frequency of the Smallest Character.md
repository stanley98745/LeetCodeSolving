## Description

```
Let's define a function f(s) over a non-empty string s, which calculates the frequency of the smallest character in s. 
For example, if s = "dcce" then f(s) = 2 because the smallest character is "c" and its frequency is 2.

Now, given string arrays queries and words, return an integer array answer, where each answer[i] is the number of words such that f(queries[i]) < f(W), where W is a word in words.
```

## How to?

1. Find out the smallest character and the frequency, for example:
   ```
   S = "dafuihlfa"
   ```
   The smallest character is "a", and its frequency is 2.
   We can use ".sorted()" for string arrangment, and ".count()" for frequency.

2. Find out frequencies of queries and words. Store these values for comparsion.
   Here, I use list for storing these values.

3. When we pick up a query, the frequencies in words should larger than the frequencies of this query.
   So, we can sort frequencies-words list with reverse command first. The list will be
   [4, 3, 7, 1, 3, 7, 9, 2] → [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7, 7, 9] (without reverse command)
   [4, 3, 7, 1, 3, 7, 9, 2] → [9, 7, 7, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1] (with reverse command)

   Compare each query with the frequencies-words list, and setting the break command for condition.


## Code 
```python
class Solution:
    def numSmallerByFrequency(self, queries: List[str], words: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        
        def frequency(S):
            return S.count(sorted(S)[0])

        freq_w = []
        for w in words:
            freq_w.append(frequency(w))
        
        freq_q = []
        for q in queries:
            freq_q.append(frequency(q))
        
        freq_w.sort(reverse=True)
        count_list = list()
        
        for q in freq_q:
            counting = 0
            for w in freq_w:
                if q < w:
                    counting += 1
                else:
                    break
            
            count_list.append(counting)
            
        return count_list
```
