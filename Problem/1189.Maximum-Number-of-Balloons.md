## Description
```
Given a string text, you want to use the characters of text to form as many instances of the word "balloon" as possible.
You can use each character in text at most once. 
Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.
```


## How to?
First, Each "balloon" consists of: 
```
b: 1
a: 1
l: 2
o: 2
n: 1
```

That is, we can calculate the amount of each letter. 
The number of "l" and "o" letters should be divided by 2 because of repeated letters in "balloon".

Second, removing the letter which is calculated. Using ".replace()"

Third, return the minimum value.


For example, 
```
b: 80
a: 90
l: 100 (divided by 2 is 50)
o: 101 (divided by 2 is also 50)
n: 45
```
That is, the "balloon" can be repeat by 45 times.


## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfBalloons(self, text: str) -> int:
        S = "balon"
        dir = dict()
        
        for s in S:
            if s in text:
                if s == 'l' or s == 'o':
                    dir[s] = int(text.count(s)/2)
                else:
                    dir[s] = text.count(s)
                text = text.replace(s, "")
            else:
                dir[s] = 0
        
        return min(dir.values())
```
